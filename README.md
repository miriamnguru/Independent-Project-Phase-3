# Predicting patterns in customer behavior that can help identify customers who are likely to churn soon from SyriaTel's services. 
**By Miriam Nguru**

Customer churn remains a significant challenge that directly impacts business profitability and sustainability in the telecommunication landscape. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or stop using its services. Churn analysis is commonly used in various industries to understand why customers leave, predict which customers are likely to churn, and develop strategies to retain customers. 

**Business Understanding**

SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, aims to understand and mitigate factors leading to a high customer churn rate. With a dataset size limitation (3333 rows), the model will cater specifically to SyriaTel's data. We aim to provide SyriaTel with the tools to proactively identify potential churners and implement targeted efforts for retaining their valuable customer base.

**Business Problem**

SyriaTel faces a 14.5% customer churn rate, surpassing the acceptable 5-7%. The goal is to
comprehend the features influencing churn and reduce it to a monthly rate of 0.58%. This is approached as a binary classification problem, recognizing the cost-effectiveness of retaining customers over acquiring new ones.

**Data Understanding**

As mentioned above the dataset size provided has a size limitation of 3333 rows. The data is divided into categorical and  numerical values. Under categorical data we shall focus on 'International Plan', 'Voicemail Plan', 'Churn' while in Numerical data we shall focus on 'Total charge per Minute', 'Area code', and 'Customer Service Calls' Just to mention a few.
Therefore we need to understand the following:
● What features in the dataset are primary determinants of customer churn and to what
extent?
● How can the findings be interpreted, and what cost-effective solutions can SyriaTel
implement?
● What is the customer charge per minute when each customer pays the average charge per customer?


**Main Objective:**
To identify key features that significantly influence a customer to churn.
To evaluate the performance of the developed model
To develop a model that accurately estimates churn likelihood.
To interpret and give relevant advice to the client. 

**Recommendations and Conclusions**

with the economic principle that retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new
ones.
